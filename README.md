I would be able to continuously provide a list of words to be unscrambled either manually or as a file containing them.

The process of unscrambling the words will be bases on an external file (which is a list of words per line).

The user should have access to this file and could modify,add or remove words as necessary. 

The process of comparing the words together should not care for any language specific rules and should be case insenstive.
